-- Identify fields of study in MAG/OECD definition of AI relevance
--
-- Kuansan Wang email 3/3: "I spent an extra day in OECD to go over the AI classification with the team. I feel their
--   current choice, selecting the core AI (MAG ID: 154945302), machine learning (MAG ID: 119857082) and their subfields,
--   seems to be a good one. Itâ€™ll exclude traditional control theory and signal processing (as Japanese wanted), but
--   can still capture the new neural representation and deep learning based work."
