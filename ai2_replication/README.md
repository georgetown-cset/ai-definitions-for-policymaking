## Ai2 Analysis Replication

This is a replication of the analysis described [here](https://medium.com/ai2-blog/china-to-overtake-us-in-ai-research-8b6b1fe30595), using the replication materials posted to [GitHub](https://github.com/allenai/china_ai). Our chief goal is to validate our own related analysis, using our own MAG data, and then assess the sensitivity of the analysis to some choices that we've made.

There are some differences between what we do here and the original analysis:

- The original analysis was done in March, 2019 and we're replicating it in March, 2020. The underlying MAG data has changed. We'll restrict the data to publications before 2019, but recent years and 2018 in particular may look different as a result of MAG updates.

There are five outputs:

- `all_papers.png`
- `chinas_drop_vs_market_share.png`
- `Share of Papers in the Top 1%.png`
- `Share of Papers in the Top 10%.png`
- `Share of Papers in the Top 50%.png`
